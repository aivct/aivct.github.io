		<h1>FAQ</h1>
		<h2>## Why? ##</h2>
		<p>If a British author can publish his unedited notes on his vacation in Australia and force us to analyze it in English class, then I can publish this thing! Whatever it is.</p>
		
		<h2>## Seriously, what is it? ## </h2>
		<p>It is an idea expressed succinctly, by someone who started off writing short stories, but got too lazy to write even that. This is written for 'aspriring authors' and other procrastinators who have somehow run out of TV-Tropes and Wikipedia articles to binge. Not all of these are complete; a lot of ideas are missing their 'punchline', but I have found something in them meaningful enough to put up anyways. I may update/ruin them as I get new ideas.</p>
		
		<h2>## There is a Factual Error! ##</h2>
		<p>What? Tell me quickly! As a pedant, I absolutely cannot stand factual errors! If it is a difference in opinion though, please write anyways; I just like receiving mail.</p>

		<h2>## You have plagiarized a famous author! ##</h2>
		<p>Of course I have, there is nothing new under the sun; but seriously, this is my unedited notebook, and my handwriting is terrible. If I did, send me an email (see below) and I'll add an attribution. 
		I paraphrase mostly because I can't remember anything (it's why I have a notebook in the first place.
		Also related unrelated; I also steal ideas from all sorts of places, like forums, discussions, youtube comments, you know, centers of rhetoric and learned people, so if I have done so and forgotten, tell me too.</p>

		<h2>## But your notebook is digitial! ##</h2>
		<p>Shhh... nobody needs to know. Hang on, do you actually have a question or are you just heckling?</p>

		<h2>## Is this prose or poetry? ##</h2>
		<p>I do not claim to understand the slightest bit in writing poetry, which is far more difficult than prose, and I am content to just do this. 
		I'm pretty sure I stole this idea from another site which for the life of me I cannot remember (sorry!), but it's a good idea. I think it was called microprose or something.
		Plus this is a great excuse for me to browse the internet and call it 'research'.</p>

		<h2>## Why are you called aivct? ##</h2>
		<p>Because four-letter acronyms are so out of style! No but seriously you should read more Smee-bck and ... I'm not even going to pretend to pronounce it not that it needs my pretentious support, xkcd.</p>

		<h2>## I have an idea for a... whatever these things are called! ##</h2>
		<p>Go start your own five-lettered acronym! This is kind of personal. Also, I'm lazy.</p>

		<h2>## I feel something... like, a feeling, that I can't place, in one of your quotes, but not the others ##</h2>
		<p>Okay, stop right there. Have you watched Love Death and Robots on Netflix? 
		There's an episode about a pool cleaner robot who is Banksy, and he, or it, finds ultimate fulfillment only by returning to his primitive state cleaning pool tiles instead of, y'know, being Banksy.
		I don't usually offer unsolicited advice, but this is kind of one of the reasons I started this project. 
		If you're not sure that the search for your meaning is not just a reflection of a memory half-forgotten, I do suggest you find something to distract you from the human condition. 
		Like this, for instance, only not this because it's already taken. Find your own shtick!</p>
