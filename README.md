## notes on depression
at times you feel as if you wish to run, <br>
not run towards but run from <br>

you want to cry but the tears are stuck <br>
that makes you want to cry more <br>

it's 6 AM on a Sunday. you have not slept <br>
since last night. the sunrise is beautiful <br>

you wish the sky was raining, <br>
and that early dawn gray could stay forever <br>

there's a quaint English town filled with murder. <br>
you've been reading webcomics. <br>

Sondheim is dead. George is gone, he was never here. <br> 
the park is empty, you're typing in all lower case <br>

so many shoulds, so few dones, <br>
so many regrets, so much dread <br>

wishing you could lie down and never get back up.

PS: but this is a really good font. and the formatting is really nice. and you could almost feel a hint of pride.
