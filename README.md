what started as an existential crisis at ~5am~ ~9pm~ ~11pm~ 6pm

## random notes and filler to pad github contributions after jet lag
- [ ] Todo: figure out what to put on it.
- [ ] Figure out how to get out of existential rut... ~(it will pass)~ but it returns
    - [ ] Figure out how to face reality.
    - [ ] Deal with procrastination
        - [x] Why is the idea of doing something almost always better than actually doing it? (That's just human nature)
    - [ ] What am I doing with my life?
        - [x] Something is not *the* thing. (None of us [fit in boxes](https://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/04/17/the-null-hypothecis/). There is *always* contrary evidence. Make a decision.)
        - [ ] Where is my port of call?

## zeitgeist

It comes and it goes; why, the winds change so often that you'd think it could only be chance.
