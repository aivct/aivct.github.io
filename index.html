	<h1 style="border-bottom:1px solid">An Irregular Verb Called Truth</h1>
	<p><i>Because 4-letter acronyms are so last decade.</i></p>
	
	<h2>Qu'est que c'est?</h2>
	<p>Moi, je suis comme vous. En recherches des choses perdues, qui s'apparait un ou deux temps quand nous ne les regardons pas. Donc, c'est mon cahier en ligne, une collection de choses que je pense sont utiles pour cette raison.</p>
	
	<h2>Your French is terrible</h2>
	<p>I took four years of highschool French and this is the result. I'm just surprised that I still remember anything.</p>
	
	<h2>So what is this really about?</h2>
	<p>An existential crisis in the middle of 3am, during the climax of the covid-19 pandemic of 2019-2021 (hopefully)[2022 update: nope, still ongoing]. It was inevitable.</p>
	
	<h2>Why no CSS?</h2>
	<p>Because that's my day job. And I don't trust the information on websites with pretty CSS (relevant <a href="https://xkcd.com/1301/">xkcd</a>).</p>
	
	<h2>Doodles</h2>
	<h3>Heroes</h3>
	<p><a href="./doodles/heroes/index.html"><img src="./assets/images/doodle previews/hero_preview.png" width=400/></a><p>
	<p>What happens when heroes die and found towns. Made using JS pages, a defunct set of UI components for JS.</p>

	<h3>Simple Dungeon Crawler</h3>
	<p><a href="./doodles/simpledungeoncrawler/index.html"><img src="./assets/images/doodle previews/simpledungeoncrawler_preview.PNG" width=400/></a><p>
	<p>My first game that had sound and art and all that. I don't usually like 'arcade' games, but this was the first time I tried to make a game more arcade-like.</p>
	
	<h3>Art Toys</h3>
	<p><a href="https://aivct.github.io/aivct-js-art-toys/"><img src="./assets/images/doodle previews/perspective_preview.PNG" width=400/></a><p>
	<p>The result of a surprisingly smooth attempt to combine programming and art. </p>
	
	<h2 style="border-bottom:1px solid">Footer, I guess, though there's nothing here. You can go now. Go take a walk. Enjoy the countryside. If you live in a city, doing the latter will guarantee you do a lot of the former. Actually it's ridiculous how car-centric most cities have become. Why does a driver's license double as ID anyways? What if I bike to work? Oh wait, I can't, because this is North America, smack-dab middle of car country. Anyways, rant over. Seriously, breathe some outdoor air. Unless you live next to a highway, in which case... don't go outside, I guess?</h2>
