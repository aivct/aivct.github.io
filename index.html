	<h2>Qu'est que c'est?</h2>
	<p>Moi, je suis comme vous. En recherches des choses perdues, qui s'apparait un ou deux temps quand nous ne les regardons pas. Donc, c'est mon cahier en ligne, une collection de choses que je pense sont utiles pour cette raison.</p>
	
	<h2>Your French is terrible</h2>
	<p>I took four years of highschool French and this is the result. I'm just surprised that I still remember anything.</p>
	
	<h2>So what is this really about?</h2>
	<p>An existential crisis in the middle of 3am, during the climax of the covid-19 pandemic of 2019-2021 (hopefully)[2022 update: nope, still ongoing]. It was inevitable.</p>
	
	<h2>Why no CSS?</h2>
	<p>Because I can, and also (<a href="https://xkcd.com/1301/">xkcd</a>).</p>
	
	<h2>Doodles</h2>
	<h3>Heroes</h3>
	<p><a href="./doodles/heroes/index.html"><img src="./assets/images/doodle previews/hero_preview.png" width=400/></a><p>
	<p>What happens when heroes die and found towns. Made using JS pages, a defunct set of UI components for JS.</p>

	<h3>Simple Dungeon Crawler</h3>
	<p><a href="./doodles/simpledungeoncrawler/index.html"><img src="./assets/images/doodle previews/simpledungeoncrawler_preview.PNG" width=400/></a><p>
	<p>My first game that had sound and art and all that. I don't usually like 'arcade' games, but this was the first time I tried to make a game more arcade-like.</p>
	
	<h3>Art Toys</h3>
	<p><a href="https://aivct.github.io/aivct-js-art-toys/"><img src="./assets/images/doodle previews/perspective_preview.PNG" width=400/></a><p>
	<p>The result of a surprisingly smooth attempt to combine programming and art. </p>
	
	<h2>Why do you make things?</h2>
	<p>I say to myself, dear hypothetical questioner, giggling madly while being of no use to society. Why did I write a set of UI components in JS canvas that nobody uses? Why did I waste a morning analyzing the frequency of every word in the dictionary? Why do I do anything? Do you know? If you have an answer please tell me because I have no idea.</p>
